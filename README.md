Here is a 7z archive that includes all the newest source and executables for Windows, Linux, & OSX:

https://github.com/fastrgv/Interval-RPN-Calculator/releases/download/v2.0.7/irpn12oct23.7z


* On OSX, Keka works well for 7Z files. The command-line for Keka is:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)




### Note: Please ignore the "Source code" zip & tar.gz files. (They are auto-generated by GitHub). Click on the large 7z file under releases to download all source & binaries (Windows,Mac & Linux). Then, type "7z x filename" to extract the archive.

## More change-history at end of file


## Brief Description
This terminal app runs on PCs or laptops running Windows, OSX, or GNU/Linux.  It attempts to mimic the functionality of an HP ReversePolishNotation [RPN] calculator with the added enhancement of interval output.  So along with your answer, you get a good idea of its trustworthiness.

Key Map:

             <e>=>{EEX}      <E>=>{e^x}      <^>=>{x^y}
             
             <s>=>{sin}      <c>=>{cos}      <t>=>{tan}
             
             <S>=>{asin}     <C>=>{acos}     <T>=>{atan}
             
             <l>=>{ln}       <p>=>{pi}       <r>=>{sqrt}
             
             <L>=>{lg}       <D>=>{Deg}      <R>=>{Rad}
             
             <x>=>{X:Y}      <m>=>{STO}      <M>=>{RCL}


### Operation
Type numbers and hit (enter) to push each of them onto the RPN stack.  Then a single key defines the desired operation.

RPN means that you enter the numbers first, then define the operation.  A unary operator, like sin, will apply the function to the number at the top of the numeric stack, then push the result back on the stack top.  A binary operator will pop two values off the stack, then perform the operation on them, and push the result back on the stack top.

For those familiar with the HP RPN calculators, the number entry here differs slightly.  To enter scientific notation you simply type the number as you would normally, eg "1.3e5" or "1.3e-6" followed by the (enter)-key.  

In order that math OPs only require a single keystroke
**a unary minus is not allowed**
The (n)-key will negate the value at the stack top. 
(i.e.: typing "-1.3e-6" is not allowed)

The allowed binary operators are {plus,minus,times,divide,pow}.  These are invoked with the usual keyboard keys (^ is pow).

The (h)-key [Help] will always show the menu.


### Memory Function (mk/Mk, k=1..9):

Enter a number, then type m3 + (enter), to store it in memory #3 location.  This will pop it off the stack.

Recall it by typing M3 + (enter);  this puts it on top of stack, while retaining it in memory location #3.



#### Example output [ ln(1.3e-6) ]:

	1.3e-6

	1.300_000_000_000_000_000E-06 HI

	1.299_999_999_999_999_840E-06 LO    [ stack.top: 1 ]

	l

	 LN 

	-13.553_146_293_496_780_800 HI

	-13.553_146_293_496_785_600 LO    [ stack.top: 1 ]





## Mini Thin Binding to Boost Intervals

Ada developers note that this app includes a minimal Ada-binding to the Boost Interval C++ library.  But, more importantly, it demonstrates the methodology so you can expand the binding to include access to other functionality, as needed.

## Setup & Running:
The application's root directory [~/intRpn/] contains files for deployment on 3 platforms:  1)OS-X, 2)linux, 3)Windows, in addition to all the source code. This app is completely self contained and will run without installing any third party software onto your system.

Unzip the archive.

* On Linux & Windows, 7z [www.7-zip.org] works well for this. The proper command to extract the archive and maintain the directory structure is "7z x filename".

* On OSX, Keka works well. The command-line for Keka works thusly:
	* /Applications/Keka.app/Contents/MacOS/Keka --cli 7z x (filename.7z)

After the archive is unzipped...

Open a commandline terminal, and cd to the install directory.

To initiate, type:

	"irpn.bat" on Windows
	"irpn_gnu" on Linux
	"irpn_osx" on Mac/OSX



-------------------------------------------------------------------
The h-key (Help/Hint) will show the menu.

Remember that a unary minus is not allowed
Use the n-key to CHS [ChangeSign(negate) the stack top].


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rebuild Instructions

This app should run as delivered, but if you wish to build it yourself 
you must install the boost libs. The scripts below assume:
	a) osx,linux: BOOST_ROOT = $HOME/Downloads/boost_1_78_0
	b) Windows: BOOST_ROOT=%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\boost_1_74_0
...so you need to modify the scripts according to
your boost home directory.


**Windows** => wcmp.bat

**GNU/Linux** => lcmp.sh

**Mac/OSX** => ocmp.sh


## TBD

Crashes due to bad input keystrokes are still possible.  Needs to improve.
If you want to help fix these, send me a script so I can reproduce your problem.
